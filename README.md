# HTTPrint

A very simple web interface to upload and print files.


## Install and run

Dependencies:
* Python 3
* **pdfinfo** executable; usually found in the **poppler-utils** package


To install it:
``` bash
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
sudo python3 get-pip.py
# if you want to install these modules for an unprivileged user, add --user and remove "sudo";
# if you want to upgrade the versions already present in the system, also add --upgrade
sudo pip3 install tornado
git clone https://github.com/alberanid/httprint
cd httprint
./httprint.py --debug
```

Now you can **point your browser to [http://localhost:7777/](http://localhost:7777/)**

You can also **run the server in https**, putting in the *ssl* directory two files named *httprint_key.pem* and *httprint_cert.pem*

By default:

* the **--print-with-code** argument is true, and the uploaded files are just scheduled for priting. To actually print them, you should supply the generated code, for example: `curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/api/print/1234`
* **--max-pages** is set to 10, limiting the number of allowed copies
* **--pdf-only** is true, meaning that only PDF files are allowed
* **--check-pdf-pages** is true, and the number of pages of a PDF are taken into consideration, calculating the maximum number of pages to print

See the **--help** output for more options.

Once a document is queued, it can be made persistent creating an empty file *code-docname.pdf.keep* in the *queue* directory.
